# Haiku

This is the repository for a website to present my haikus.

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with the technologies that go
into full-stack development. This project will start with javascript and React
for the interface, and as it expands, I might look into adding MongoDB and
integrations if I want to develop a full-fledged app.

I love writing haikus about cringe-y work-related buzzwords. Even though sharing
my haikus by email is the most thematic, I'd love cleaner way to share them.
Enter graphic design and web development!

This app works entirely client-side.
